We took the HeuristicAgent as a basis to develop our own, additionally the forward model was copied to allow changes.
Improvements we made are:
* The node construction was sped up by calling prune less often. This was achieved by explicitly excluding illegal moves from being considered.
* Pruning also was improved by not checking legality of actions multiple times.
* Value function: The type of collected item is considered to not collect a Kick when the agent already has this ability.
* Value function: Only own bombs are looked at when calculating how many clouds can be destroyed, additionally the bomb range is taken into account.
* Value function: when there are little clouds remaining, or the agent has collected all possible upgrades, it goes into "attack mode".
* Value function: In attack mode, the agent prioritises going towards the other agent, and placing bombs if the other agent is in range.
* Forward model: Flame ticks are modeled correctly, ammo is tracked.
